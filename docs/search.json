You can install them all at once by running the following code in the R command line:\n\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"NetLogoR\", \"testthat\"))\n\n\n\nYou need to be familiar with R. This workshop is not about learning how to code on R but how to use an R package in particular. For example, you need to be familiar with for loops and how to create function (even if they are very simple ones).\nFor any help before or after the workshop\nSarah Bauduin: sarah.bauduin@ofb.gouv.fr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
