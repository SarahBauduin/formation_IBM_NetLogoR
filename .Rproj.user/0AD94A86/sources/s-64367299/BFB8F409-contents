# Timeline

- Day 1
   - Getting familiar with individual-based models (IBMs)
   - Getting familiar with `NetLogoR`
   - Understanding simple models coded in `NetLogoR`
- Day 2
   - Understanding more complex models coded in `NetLogoR`
   - Debugging IBMs
   - Parameterizing IBMs
   - Publishing IBMs
   - Coding on your own

# Requirements

* Install [`R`](https://cloud.r-project.org/) and [`RStudio`](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

* Install the following `R` packages: `NetLogoR`, `testthat`. You can install them all at once by running the following code in the `R` command line:

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages(c("NetLogoR", "testthat"))
```

* You need to be familiar with `R`. This workshop is not about learning how to code on `R` but how to use an `R` package in particular. For example, you need to be familiar with for loops and how to create function (even if they are very simple ones).
